Hello world, i'm Christina - a senior graphic designer - making a career shift into Software Engineering. My Stepdad, Jeffrey Ranney - a hugely successful software engineer - who worked for EDS, IBM, HP, and finally NASCO; is my hugeest inspiration for making the move. Years ago, before he passed away, he asked me to switch careers and apply to NASCO but I never took that leap. Now that he is gone and I am making this transition, I wish I had sooner because now I no longer have him by my side or as a great resource for advice. So I will be navigating this space on my own. He wrote a program called FROG - I have no idea what it does but I am going to find out by talking with his old colleagues. In my journey in software engineering, I hope to learn continously as he did (he was self taught), and also discover his world and a part of who he was. I can only strive to be as great as he was. He will carry on through everything I create and I hope to learn from everyone I meet in some way or another. Until next time.
